# About API Proxy Server
Simple Node.js API Proxy Server hiding your private API keys from app clients and avoiding CORS errors. I've added both HTTP and HTTPS version. Please note that for HTTPS version you'll need to include valid certificate which you can request from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/). I've deployed this server on [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) device in [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/) for using with Frontend applications.

## Features
Server uses [Express Rate Limiter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit) for limiting user queries *(default 50 queries in 10 minutes)*. Also, every query is cached by [ApiCache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apicache). Fetching data is done by [Needle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/needle), simple and lightweight HTTP Client. For easier testing and developing [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is recommended which then restarts server on every file change so you don't have to do it manually. To check response from API I've used [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) but it is possible to use your default web browser.
